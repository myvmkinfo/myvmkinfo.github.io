						<ul>
							<li>In the first two levels, try to not worry all too much about the combos. Instead, focus more on getting all <em>Flawless</em>.</li>
							<li>When you start to get to get to around the third level, start going for the combos (<em title="Be smart about it. Don't wait too long for a combo, since the amount of points gained from the combo can eventually not become worth it.">within moderation</em>). <strong><-- Hover Over This - - </strong></li>
							<li>Pay attention to the <em>Coming In</em> section in the lower right corner. Knowing what is coming up can be very helpful.</li>
							<li>Practice. Getting familiar with the minigame itself is really important if you want to get a good score. Once you've played the game quite a bit, you start to learn the patterns and order of the various seeds.</li>

							<li>Try to not speed up or slow down as much as possible, as this can waste some gas you might need later.</li>
							<li>Make sure to get all of the <em>film</em> and <em>gas</em>. You don't want to run out of either of those thing..!</li>
