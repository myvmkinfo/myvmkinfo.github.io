		<h1>INFO</h1>

		<section class="history">
			<h2 class="heading">HISTORY</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;It all started when the original VMK (Virtual Magic Kingdom), created by Disney, shut down on May 21st, 2008. Around five years later, in late August, OpenVMK was released after being in developement for a while. The state OpenVMK was in shortly after being released was not very good. Eventually, things started to get out of control and OpenVMK had to shut down after only a couple of weeks. It was a shame; people could only relive their childhood for a few weeks.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;However, not too long after that, MyVMK was released. MyVMK was an alternate game released by one of the developers, Amy, who was working on OpenVMK. It wasn't perfect right away, however, after a few more months, things started to get better. In the first month, there weren't any of the original minigames. There was a temporary minigame added in where you would have to collect shells. This allowed people to still get credits to be able to buy things all around the kingdom.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;The order of minigames added into the game went <em>Jungle Cruise, Castle Fireworks Remixed, Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean,</em> and <em>Castle Fireworks Classic</em>. It took a little over a year for all of the minigames to get added into the game. The only original main feature left to be created (which might not be done anytime soon) is the <em>Magic Checkers</em> game. However, this isn't really a high priority, since not many people have been asking for it and it isn't a huge "game changer."</p>
			<p>&nbsp;MyVMK has now been going on for a little over two years. It's pretty crazy how long it has been since it was released. The game has gotten to a point where just about every original item has been released into the game. They now have been adding in brand-new items, which were never in the game (a lot of the weren't even things thought of before MyVMK closed its gates ie. <em>Frozen</em> items).</p>
