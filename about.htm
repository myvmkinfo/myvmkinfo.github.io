			<p>KrazyKid is known to be a fairly good Castle Fireworks Remixed player, currently with the 15th highest score overall. His highest score in Castle Fireworks Remixed is currently <em>8935</em>. He decided to create this website as a way to allow other players to learn about all sorts of things inside the game. While this isn't an official guide to anything and is more of a personal opinion, he believes it will be helpful for some people. When online, KrazyKid enjoys playing minigames such as Castle Fireworks Remixed and Pirates of the Caribbean. Occasionally, he will start working on a room. His most recently created room is one he made for a <em>Fireworks Magic Shop</em> he was going to have.</p>
